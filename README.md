## Description
For peeps who like to play videogames or would like to learn more about them. This super fun full stack application allows users to have fun with the games available in our database. Unlike other similar apps, users have the option to create an account and upload their own videogames for others to discover.

## User Stories

        As a videogame enthusiast 
        I want an app that saves my progress and creates my profile
        So that I can keep leveling up 

        As a casual gamer 
        I want to just have fun
        So that I can just play the games available without signing up.

        As a new game developer
        I want people to test my game
        So that I can make improvements and get feedback
